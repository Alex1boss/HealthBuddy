## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single-page application** design using server-side rendered HTML templates
- **Bootstrap 5** framework for responsive grid system and components
- **Custom CSS** with CSS variables for consistent theming and design system
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for calculator functionality and user interactions
- **Google Fonts (Inter)** for modern typography
- **Font Awesome** icons for visual elements

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask** web framework with PostgreSQL database integration
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for database ORM and management
- **Replit Authentication** using OAuth2/OpenID Connect for user management
- **Flask-Login** for session management and user authentication
- **Template-based rendering** using Jinja2 templates with authentication context
- **RESTful API endpoints** for calculation processing and history management
- **Environment-based configuration** for session secrets and database connections

### Design System
- **Color scheme**: Primary blue (#1E90FF) for water/health, secondary green (#32CD32) for fitness
- **Consistent styling**: 16px border radius, subtle shadows, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap breakpoints
- **Accessibility considerations**: Proper form labels and semantic HTML structure

### Calculator Logic
- **Server-side calculations** with database persistence for authenticated users
- **AJAX-based communication** between frontend and backend for seamless UX
- **Input validation** on both client and server sides with comprehensive error handling
- **Animated results display** with fade-in effects and save confirmation feedback
- **Health recommendations** based on weight input using standard formulas (weight Ã— 0.033L for water)
- **Calculation history tracking** with timestamp and user association

### Content Strategy
- **SEO optimization** with proper meta tags and descriptions
- **AdSense placeholder integration** for potential monetization
- **Health tips section** providing educational value beyond the calculator
