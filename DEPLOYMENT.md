# Netlify Deployment Guide

Your Daily Water Calculator is now ready for deployment to Netlify! 

## What I've Fixed

âœ… **Converted Flask app to static website** - Removed server dependencies
âœ… **Created `index.html`** - Works without Flask template engine  
âœ… **Added `_redirects` file** - Handles routing for single-page app
âœ… **Updated asset paths** - Direct links to CSS/JS files
âœ… **SEO optimized** - Meta tags and structured data included

## Files Ready for Deployment

The following files should be deployed to Netlify:

```
index.html           (Main HTML file)
static/css/main.css  (Styles)
static/js/calculator.js (Calculator functionality)
_redirects          (Netlify routing rules)
```

## How to Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Create a folder on your computer called `water-calculator`
2. Copy these files into it:
   - `index.html`
   - `static/` folder (with css and js folders inside)
   - `_redirects`
3. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
4. Drag the entire folder to the Netlify deployment area

2. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
3. Set build settings:
   - **Publish directory**: `/` (root)
