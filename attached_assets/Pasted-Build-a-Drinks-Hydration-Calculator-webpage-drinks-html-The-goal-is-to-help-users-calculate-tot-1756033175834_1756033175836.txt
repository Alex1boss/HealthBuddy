Build a Drinks & Hydration Calculator webpage (drinks.html).
The goal is to help users calculate total caffeine intake + net hydration effect from different beverages.
This will be part of a health-focused site, so accuracy, usability, and clean design are critical.

1. Page Setup

File: drinks.html (standalone, deploy-ready).

Include everything (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in one file.

Mobile-first, responsive design.

Theme: light blue + white + soft gray (hydration/water-inspired).

Use modern fonts (sans-serif, rounded corners, shadows).

Add a top header: “💧 Drinks & Hydration Calculator”.

Sub-header: “Track caffeine intake and hydration effect of your drinks.”

2. Drink Inputs

Create sections for the following drink categories, each with number input for servings:

☕ Coffee

Default: 95 mg caffeine / 8 oz cup.

Input: “How many cups of coffee?”

Show tooltip: “Standard brewed coffee has ~95 mg per 8 oz (240 ml).”

🍵 Tea

Default: 47 mg caffeine / 8 oz cup.

Input: “How many cups of tea?”

Tooltip: “Black tea ~47 mg per 8 oz. Green tea slightly less.”

🥤 Soda

Default: 40 mg caffeine / 12 oz can.

Input: “How many cans of soda?”

Tooltip: “Typical cola has ~40 mg per 12 oz can.”

⚡ Energy Drinks

Default: 80 mg caffeine / 8 oz can.

Input: “How many energy drinks?”

Tooltip: “Varies widely (80–160 mg). Default 80 mg / 8 oz.”

➕ Custom Drink

Fields:

Drink Name (text input).

Caffeine per serving (mg).

Serving size (oz).

Number of servings.

Tooltip: “Enter any other caffeinated beverage.”

3. User Settings

Add checkbox: “Pregnant / Nursing?” → sets safe caffeine limit = 200 mg.

Default safe limit for general users = 400 mg.

Unit system: Keep in mg for caffeine, ml for fluids (convert oz → ml automatically, 1 oz = 29.57 ml).

4. Calculation Logic

For each drink:

Caffeine = servings × caffeine per serving.

Fluid = servings × fluid ounces × 29.57 ml.

Add to totals.

Apply hydration adjustment:

If total caffeine < 300 mg → full fluid counts.

If 300–500 mg → subtract 10% of total fluid volume.

If > 500 mg → subtract 15% of total fluid volume.

Compare total caffeine to safe daily limit:

✅ “Safe range” (< 75% of limit).

⚠️ “Close to limit” (75–100%).

❌ “Exceeds safe limit” (> 100%).

5. Results Section

After pressing Calculate, show:

Total Caffeine (mg).

% of safe daily limit.

Net Hydration (ml).

A message:

“✅ Safe: Well within daily limits.”

“⚠️ Careful: Close to your daily max.”

“❌ Over Limit: Reduce caffeine intake.”

Show hydration insight line:

“Hydration positive.”

“Slight hydration reduction.”

“Hydration negative risk.”

Example output:

“You consumed 325 mg caffeine (81% of safe daily limit).”

“Net hydration: 1,750 ml after adjustment.”

“⚠️ You’re close to your daily caffeine limit. Consider reducing soda or energy drinks.”

6. Buttons & Interactivity

Calculate button → runs JS calculations.

Reset (Clear All) button → resets inputs to default.

Inputs should validate: no negative numbers.

If user leaves inputs blank → treat as 0.

7. Extra Features

Add hydration tip at bottom:
“💡 Tip: Aim for 2–3 liters of total water daily. Caffeinated drinks can contribute, but balance with plain water.”

Add small hydration icon (💧) beside results.

Add error handling: If user enters caffeine = 0, show “You haven’t logged any drinks yet.”

Add smooth animations for result section (fade in).

Make sure layout works on mobile screens (inputs stacked vertically).

8. Technical Requirements

Use only HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (no React, no frameworks).

Keep JS inline at bottom of HTML.

Write clean, commented code for readability.

Optimized for Netlify deployment (no external dependencies required).

Place results section below inputs, styled in a card with shadow + rounded corners.

9. Deployment Check

After finishing:

File must be named drinks.html.

When deployed on Netlify, page must load instantly.

No console errors in browser dev tools.

Design should look professional and not like a default form.

10. Example User Flow

User enters: 2 coffees, 1 tea, 1 soda.

Clicks Calculate.

Output:

“Total caffeine: 277 mg (69% of safe daily limit).”

“Net hydration: 920 ml (hydration positive).”

“✅ Safe range.”

✅ Final Deliverable:
A polished drinks.html file that calculates caffeine + hydration, displays results clearly, and looks professional on mobile + desktop.
