Cons (issues)

Confusing percentages →

95 mg caffeine = only 24% of the adult safe limit (400 mg), not 95%.

Showing “95%” for such a low caffeine input could confuse users.

Lack of context for hydration number →

“237 ml Net Hydration” looks random.

Users don’t know if that’s good, bad, or what portion of their daily water intake it represents.

“Is it Safe for Me?” feels unfinished →

It looks like a question the site should answer, not throw back to the user.

Could feel less professional to AdSense reviewers.

Tone mismatch →

“⚠️ Caution” at 95 mg is overly alarming (a single cup of coffee is safe for almost everyone).

Users might stop trusting results if warnings don’t match reality.

Design hierarchy is flat →

All results (mg, %, ml, caution) look similar, so it’s harder for users to see the most important takeaway.

🔧 How to Improve (updates you can make)

Here’s what I’d suggest to refine it:

1. Fix % Calculation

Instead of 95%, calculate properly against the safe limit.

Example: 95 mg ÷ 400 mg = 24% (for general adults).

For pregnancy mode → 95 ÷ 200 = 48%.

Show correct percentage with clear label:

“24% of safe daily limit (400 mg)”

2. Give Hydration Context

Instead of just “237 ml Net Hydration,” make it meaningful:

“Net Hydration: +237 ml (toward your daily 2,500 ml goal)”

Add a small progress bar toward hydration goals.

3. Replace “Is it Safe for Me?” with Actionable Advice

Examples:

✅ If safe: “You are well within safe caffeine intake. Keep hydrated!”

⚠️ If close: “You’re nearing your daily caffeine limit. Consider reducing energy drinks.”

❌ If exceeded: “You’ve exceeded your daily caffeine limit. Try replacing with water or decaf.”

4. Tone & Visual Improvements

Use color coding:

Green for safe

Yellow for caution

Red for over limit

Use icons consistently (✅, ⚠️, ❌)

Bold the most important line (e.g., “Safe” or “Caution”).

5. Better Layout Example

Instead of your current flat list, it could look like:

💧 Your Caffeine & Hydration Results

☕ Total Caffeine: 95 mg
📊 Safe Limit Used: 24% (of 400 mg)
💧 Net Hydration: +237 ml toward your daily goal
✅ Status: Safe – well within healthy range.
